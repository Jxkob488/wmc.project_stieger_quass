# Local Finder

## Project Idea
The Project Finder is a website, which helps you finding different shops. You can choose between restaurants, clothing boutiques, gyms,... The chosen shops are then shown on the map.

The Local Finder is targeted for people who are interested to explore the city or want to find new shops.

## Structure of the websites
The website wil include 2 pages:
On the first page you can see a short introduction (index.html).
On the second page you can see the map and on the right the buttons to highlight the wanted shops.

## Design and Layout
**Colors:**  
The website will use simple and neutral colors like grey, white and black for the bakground and Text. The map uses colors like green and light blue. The highlighted shops are shown in an outstanding color like yellow.  
**Fonts:**  
Our website uses a simple sans-serif font like *Lato*.  
**Shapes:**  
Elements like buttons and info boxes will have slightly rounded corners for a soft and modern appearance.  
**Navigation Menu:**  
A minimal horizontal navigation bar at the top with two links to switch between the two pages.

The Navigation Menu will stay the same on both pages.
