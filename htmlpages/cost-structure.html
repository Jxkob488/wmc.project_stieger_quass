        <h1>Overview: Cost Structure</h1>

        <div role="article" aria-labelledby="cost-models-title">
            <section>
                <p>Online shop systems follow different cost models depending on technology, hosting approach, and the
                    target business size. The most common approach is <strong>subscription-based pricing</strong>, where
                    the platform is offered as a cloud service (SaaS) with monthly or yearly plans. These subscriptions
                    often include hosting, updates, security, and basic support.</p>

                <p><strong>Self-hosted platforms</strong> such as WooCommerce or PrestaShop use a more flexible and
                    modular cost structure. The base system is often free, but additional expenses arise from hosting,
                    premium themes, plugins, and maintenance. This model can be cheaper at the start but more complex in
                    the long run.</p>

                <p><strong>Enterprise systems</strong> (e.g., Adobe Commerce, SAP Commerce) rely on annual or multi‑year
                    licensing fees. They provide advanced scalability, integrations, automation tools, and professional
                    support — but they require a significantly larger budget.</p>

                <p>Besides the base pricing, <strong>transaction fees</strong> are an important cost factor. Payment
                    providers like PayPal, Stripe, or Klarna charge a percentage of each order plus a fixed fee. Some
                    platforms add their own transaction fees if you don’t use their preferred payment gateway.</p>
