                        <h2>📌 Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The checkout process is one of the most important parts of an online shop.
                            It is the final step before a purchase is completed, so it has a direct
                            impact on conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good checkout should be simple, fast and transparent. Customers should
                            understand each step, what information is needed and what the final price
                            will be before confirming the order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many customers leave a shop if the checkout feels complicated or takes too
                            long. Because of that, shop systems often try to reduce unnecessary steps
                            and focus on a clear user flow.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🧾 Typical Checkout Steps</h2>
                        <p>
                            Most modern shop systems follow a structured checkout flow. This guides users
                            through the purchase without overwhelming them.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>🛍️ Cart overview with selected products</li>
                            <li>👤 Customer information (name, email, address)</li>
                            <li>📦 Shipping method selection</li>
                            <li>💳 Payment method selection</li>
                            <li>✅ Order review and confirmation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Some shops use a one-page checkout where everything is on one page. Others use
                            a multi-step checkout to make the process clearer, especially for bigger orders.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>✨ User Experience & Usability</h2>
                        <p>
                            A smooth user experience is essential during checkout. Forms should be clearly
                            structured, labels easy to understand and error messages helpful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Features like autofill, address suggestions and real-time validation reduce
                            mistakes and make the checkout faster. A progress indicator can also help
                            customers understand how many steps are left.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another important factor is transparency. Showing shipping costs and taxes early
                            helps avoid surprises at the end, which can reduce cart abandonment.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🔒 Security & Trust</h2>
                        <p>
                            Customers must feel safe when entering personal and payment information. A secure
                            checkout process uses HTTPS encryption and trusted payment providers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trust elements such as clear return policies, privacy information and visible
                            security messages can increase confidence. This is especially important for new
                            customers who do not know the shop yet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shops should also protect accounts with strong passwords and, if possible,
                            additional security features like two-factor authentication.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>📱 Mobile Checkout</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since many people shop on smartphones, the checkout process must be fully responsive.
                            Buttons should be large enough to tap and forms should be easy to fill out on small screens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mobile-friendly checkouts often use fewer fields, simple layouts and quick payment
                            methods. A mobile-optimized checkout can strongly improve completion rates.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🧠 Common Problems</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some typical reasons why customers stop during checkout are unexpected costs,
                            too many form fields, missing payment options or slow loading times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shop systems try to reduce these problems by offering guest checkout, saving
                            addresses, and providing multiple payment methods.
                        </p>
