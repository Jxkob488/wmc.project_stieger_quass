                        <p>
                            Internationalization means preparing an online shop to work in different
                            countries and markets. This includes language settings, currencies and
                            country-specific rules.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A shop that is built for international customers can reach more people and
                            increase sales. However, internationalization also creates new challenges,
                            such as different taxes, legal requirements and shipping options.
                        </p>

                            <h2>🗣️ Multilingual Content</h2>
                            <p>
                                One of the most important parts of internationalization is supporting
                                multiple languages. This includes product descriptions, navigation,
                                checkout pages and customer emails.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A clear language selection improves usability and builds trust, because
                                customers understand what they are buying.

                            <p>
                                International customers often prefer to pay in their own currency.
                                Shops should display prices in different currencies and handle currency
                                conversion correctly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currency support is especially important when selling outside the EU,
                                because exchange rates can change regularly.

                            <p>
                                International shipping is usually more complex than local delivery.
                                Shops need to offer suitable shipping providers, delivery times and
                                costs depending on the country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tracking and clear shipping information can reduce customer complaints
                                and improve satisfaction.

                            <p>
                                Different countries have different tax systems and laws. Examples include
                                VAT rules, return policies and data protection regulations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shops should make sure they follow the correct legal rules for each market,
                                because mistakes can lead to problems or extra costs.

                                Localization means adapting formats and details to the region. This includes
                                date formats, phone number formats, address fields and units like kilograms
                                or pounds.

                                These small details make the shop feel more professional and user-friendly
                                for international customers.
