                        <p>
                            The target audience of a shop system describes which users typically choose
                            a specific system and for what type of online shop it is best suited.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Shop systems are designed for different experience levels, budgets and
                            project sizes. Choosing the right system depends on who operates the shop.
                        </p>

                            <h2>👤 Beginners and First-Time Shop Owners</h2>
                            <p>
                                Beginners usually prefer simple shop systems with minimal setup.
                                Hosted platforms like Shopify or Wix are common choices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These users benefit from automatic updates, built-in hosting and
                                easy product management.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The downside is limited customization and dependence on the platform.

                                Small and medium businesses often choose WooCommerce or Shopware.
                                These systems provide more flexibility and control.
                            </p>

                                This group often values scalability and long-term adaptability.

                                Developers prefer shop systems that allow full access to code
                                and server configuration.
                            </p>

                                Magento and advanced Shopware setups are typical examples.
                                These systems are powerful but complex.

                                Large companies need shop systems that support high traffic,
                                internationalization and complex product structures.
                            </p>

                                Enterprise-level systems offer maximum scalability but require
                                high budgets and technical expertise.

                                Each shop system targets a specific audience. Selecting a system
                                that matches experience level and business goals is essential
                                for long-term success.
