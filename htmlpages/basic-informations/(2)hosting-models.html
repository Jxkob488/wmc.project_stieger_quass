                        <p>
                            Hosting models describe how and where a shop system is technically operated.
                            The hosting choice directly influences loading speed, reliability, security
                            and maintenance effort.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Different shop systems rely on different hosting concepts. While some systems
                            include hosting by default, others require the shop owner to select and manage
                            a hosting environment manually.
                        </p>

                            <h2>☁️ Hosted Shop Systems</h2>
                            <p>
                                Hosted shop systems include hosting as part of the platform.
                                The provider is responsible for servers, updates, backups and security.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shopify and Wix are typical examples of hosted shop systems.
                                The shop owner only focuses on products, content and marketing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This model is especially suitable for beginners, because no technical
                                knowledge about servers or infrastructure is required.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, hosted systems offer limited control. Custom server configurations
                                and advanced optimizations are usually not possible.

                            <h2>🖥️ Self-Hosted Shop Systems</h2>
                            <p>
                                Self-hosted shop systems require the shop owner to choose a hosting provider.
                                This can be shared hosting, a virtual private server or cloud hosting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                WooCommerce and Shopware are common self-hosted shop systems.
                                They run on external hosting and offer full access to files and settings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This allows deeper customization and performance tuning, but also requires
                                regular updates, backups and security checks.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Hosting quality has a strong impact on shop performance.
                                Weak hosting can cause slow product pages or checkout failures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Growing shops often move from shared hosting to VPS or cloud hosting
                                to handle higher traffic and sales peaks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Choosing the right hosting model helps ensure stability as the shop grows.

                            <p>
                                Hosted shop systems reduce technical effort, while self-hosted systems
                                offer more control and flexibility. The best hosting model depends on
                                the chosen shop system and long-term goals.
                            </p>
