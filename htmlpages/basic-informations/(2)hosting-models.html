                        <h2>📌 Hosting Guide for Shop Systems</h2>

                        <p>
                            Choosing the right hosting model is an important step when building an online shop.
                            Different shop systems require different types of hosting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The overview below shows which hosting models are typically used with common
                            shop systems.
                        </p>

                        <h3>✔ Beginner Shops</h3>
                        <p>
                            For beginners using systems like Shopify, Wix or BigCommerce,
                            no external hosting is required because it is included.
                        </p>

                        <h3>✔ Small to Medium Shops</h3>
                        <p>
                            WooCommerce and PrestaShop usually work well with shared hosting
                            or a small VPS.
                        </p>

                        <h3>✔ Growing Shops</h3>
                        <p>
                            Shopware and larger WooCommerce shops often need VPS or cloud hosting
                            to ensure stable performance.
                        </p>

                        <h3>✔ Large and Enterprise Shops</h3>
                        <p>
                            Magento and enterprise systems usually require dedicated servers
                            or professional cloud infrastructure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In general, hosted systems are easier to manage, while self-hosted
                            systems offer more control but require technical knowledge.
                        </p>

                    <!-- GENERAL PART -->

                    <section class="mt-5">
                        <h2>📘 General Information about Hosting Models</h2>

                        <p>
                            Hosting models describe how and where an online shop is technically hosted.
                            They influence performance, scalability, costs and maintenance.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>👥 Shared Hosting</h2>

                        <p>
                            Shared hosting means that many websites use the same server.
                            Resources such as CPU and RAM are shared.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This model is cheap and easy to use, but performance can be unstable
                            when other websites generate high traffic.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🖥️ Virtual Private Server (VPS)</h2>

                        <p>
                            A VPS is a virtual server with dedicated resources.
                            It offers better performance and more control than shared hosting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            VPS hosting is suitable for shops that are growing and need more
                            flexibility.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>⚙️ Dedicated Server</h2>

                        <p>
                            A dedicated server is used by only one shop.
                            All resources are available for this single project.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It provides high performance but also requires professional
                            administration and higher costs.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>☁️ Cloud Hosting</h2>

                        <p>
                            Cloud hosting uses multiple connected servers.
                            Resources can be increased or reduced automatically.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This model is suitable for shops with changing traffic levels
                            and international customers.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🛠️ Managed Hosting</h2>

                        <p>
                            With managed hosting, the provider takes care of updates,
                            security and backups.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This reduces technical effort but increases monthly costs.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>✅ Conclusion</h2>

                        <p>
                            The right hosting model depends on the chosen shop system,
                            budget and technical skills.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Beginners usually benefit from hosted systems, while advanced
                            users can use self-hosted solutions for maximum flexibility.
                        </p>
