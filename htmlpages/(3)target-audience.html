                        <p>
                            The target audience describes the group of people who are most likely to buy
                            products in an online shop. It includes demographic, social, technical and
                            behavioral factors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A clear understanding of the target audience helps businesses design their shop,
                            choose suitable marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
