                    <p>
                        Choosing the right shop system strongly depends on the target audience
                        of the online business. Different user groups have different expectations
                        regarding usability, scalability, flexibility and technical control.
                        A system that perfectly fits one target group may be inefficient or overly
                        complex for another.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Understanding the target audience helps businesses avoid unnecessary costs,
                        reduce technical challenges and ensure long‑term growth. Factors such as
                        company size, available technical expertise, budget and growth strategy
                        play a crucial role in this decision.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Small Businesses and Startups</h2>
                    <p>
                        Small businesses and startups usually prioritize quick setup, ease of use
                        and predictable costs. They often lack dedicated technical teams and therefore
                        prefer shop systems that provide ready‑to‑use solutions with minimal configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hosted platforms are especially popular in this group because they include
                        hosting, security updates and maintenance. While customization options may
                        be limited, these systems allow entrepreneurs to focus on products, marketing
                        and customer relationships instead of technical details.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Growing Businesses</h2>
                    <p>
                        Businesses in a growth phase require more flexibility than startups.
                        They often need advanced marketing tools, integrations with external systems
                        such as ERP or CRM solutions, and better performance handling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this audience, shop systems must balance usability and customization.
                        Modular platforms or self‑hosted solutions with managed services are often
                        chosen to support expansion without excessive complexity.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Developers and Technical Teams</h2>
                    <p>
                        Developers and technically skilled teams value full control over the shop
                        system. They prefer platforms that allow deep customization, access to the
                        source code and flexible APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These systems are ideal for complex business models, custom workflows and
                        unique user experiences. However, they usually require more maintenance
                        effort and technical knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Enterprises and Large Organizations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Enterprises focus on scalability, performance and security. Their shop systems
                        must handle high traffic volumes, complex product catalogs and international
                        markets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enterprise‑level platforms often come with higher costs and longer
                        implementation times but provide advanced features such as multi‑store
                        management, role‑based access control and deep system integrations.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        In conclusion, identifying the correct target audience is a key step in selecting
                        a shop system. A well‑matched solution improves efficiency, reduces risks
                        and supports sustainable business growth.
                    </p>
