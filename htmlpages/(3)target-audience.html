                    <p class="text-center mb-4">
                        Shop systems are built for different types of businesses.
                        Company size, technical experience and long-term goals strongly
                        influence which solution is the right fit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Choosing a shop system that does not match the target audience often
                        leads to unnecessary complexity, higher costs or limited scalability.
                        A good match supports daily operations and future growth.
                    </p>

                        <h2>Typical Target Groups</h2>
                        <p>
                            Online shop operators can be grouped based on their priorities
                            and technical requirements. Each group benefits from different
                            system characteristics.

                    <section>
                        <h2>Small Businesses and Startups</h2>
                        <p>
                            Small businesses usually focus on fast setup, simple management
                            and predictable costs. Hosted shop systems with predefined
                            features are often a good choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These solutions are easy to use but may reach their limits as
                            the business grows.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Developers and Technical Teams</h2>
                        <p>
                            Developers prefer systems that allow deep customization and
                            direct access to code and infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This flexibility enables complex integrations but requires
                            technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Medium-Sized and Enterprise Businesses</h2>
                        <p>
                            Larger organizations need scalable, stable and secure systems
                            that integrate with existing business processes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These solutions are powerful but involve higher costs and
                            longer setup times.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Choosing the Right Fit</h2>
                        <p>
                            A shop system should not only fit current needs but also support
                            future development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Understanding the target audience helps avoid early system
                            migrations and creates a solid technical foundation.
                        </p>
