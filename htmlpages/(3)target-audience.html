                        <p>
                            Choosing the right shop system strongly depends on the target audience of the
                            online business. Different user groups have different expectations regarding
                            usability, scalability, flexibility and technical control.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Understanding the target audience helps businesses avoid unnecessary costs,
                            reduce technical challenges and plan realistic growth. Factors such as company
                            size, technical expertise, budget and future goals play a crucial role.

                            <p>
                                Small businesses and startups usually prioritize quick setup, ease of use
                                and predictable costs. They often do not have a dedicated technical team
                                and prefer solutions that work out of the box.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hosted platforms are popular in this group because they include hosting,
                                updates and basic security features. The downside is that customization
                                options can be limited.

                            <p>
                                Businesses in a growth phase need more flexibility. They often require
                                integrations with external systems such as ERP or CRM, better performance
                                and more advanced marketing tools.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this audience, shop systems should balance usability and customization.
                                Modular platforms or self-hosted solutions with managed services are often
                                a good choice.

                                Developers and technically skilled teams value full control. They prefer
                                platforms with flexible APIs, custom workflows and access to source code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These systems can create unique solutions, but they require more maintenance
                                and technical knowledge.

                                Enterprises focus on scalability, performance and security. Their shop systems
                                must handle high traffic, large product catalogs and international markets.
                            </p>

                                Enterprise solutions usually cost more and take longer to implement, but they
                                offer advanced features like multi-store management and role-based access control.
