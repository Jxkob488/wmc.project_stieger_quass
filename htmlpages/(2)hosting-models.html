                        <p>
                            Hosting models describe how and where an online shop is technically hosted.
                            The chosen hosting model influences performance, scalability, costs and the
                            amount of maintenance needed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A small shop with only a few visitors has different requirements than a large
                            shop with thousands of customers per day. Many businesses start with a simple
                            solution and upgrade later when traffic and sales increase.

                            <h2>👥 Shared Hosting</h2>
                            <p>
                                Shared hosting is one of the cheapest hosting options. Multiple websites share
                                the same physical server and use the same resources such as CPU, RAM and storage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is easy to set up and is often offered with simple control panels. This makes
                                it a good choice for beginners and small shops that do not have a lot of traffic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The disadvantage is that performance can be unstable. If other websites on the same
                                server have high traffic, your shop can become slower.
                            </p>

                            <h2>🖥️ Virtual Private Server (VPS)</h2>
                            <p>
                                A VPS is a virtual server on a shared physical machine. Compared to shared hosting,
                                it provides dedicated resources and more stable performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                VPS hosting is popular for growing shops because it offers more flexibility and
                                control. You can install software, configure settings and adapt the server to your
                                shop system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Depending on the provider, you may need basic server administration skills, unless
                                it is a managed VPS.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                With a dedicated server, the entire physical server is reserved for one shop system.
                                This means maximum performance and full control over the environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dedicated servers are used for high-traffic shops, complex setups or businesses with
                                strict security requirements. They are powerful but also expensive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The maintenance effort is higher because updates, monitoring and backups must be managed
                                by the company or an external service provider.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Cloud hosting uses multiple servers instead of a single machine. This makes it possible
                                to scale resources up or down depending on current demand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is a strong option for shops with traffic peaks, for example during sales events or
                                seasonal business. If the shop grows, cloud hosting can be expanded without changing the
                                entire infrastructure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Costs are often usage-based. This can be efficient, but it is important to monitor usage
                                to avoid unexpected expenses.

                            <p>
                                Managed hosting means that the provider takes care of important technical tasks such as
                                updates, backups, security patches and monitoring.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is helpful for shop owners who do not want to manage servers themselves. Managed
                                hosting can be combined with VPS, dedicated servers or cloud environments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main disadvantage is the higher price compared to unmanaged hosting.

                            <p>
                                The right hosting model depends on budget, expected traffic and technical knowledge.
                                It is common to start with shared hosting or a VPS and upgrade later when the shop
                                grows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A good hosting choice improves loading speed, stability and customer satisfaction, which
                                can directly influence sales.
