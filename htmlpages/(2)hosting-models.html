                    <p>
                        Hosting models define how an online shop is hosted, operated and maintained
                        from a technical perspective. They determine where the shop runs, which
                        resources are available and who is responsible for infrastructure management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The hosting model has a direct impact on performance, availability, security,
                        scalability and long-term operating costs. Even a well-designed shop system
                        can fail if the hosting environment is poorly chosen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In practice, hosting decisions are often underestimated. Many shops start
                        with the cheapest option and only realize the limitations once traffic grows,
                        customers complain about loading times or outages occur.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different hosting models helps
                        avoid costly migrations and technical debt later on.

                        <h2>Shared Hosting</h2>
                        <p>
                            Shared hosting is the most basic and cost-effective hosting model. Multiple
                            websites are hosted on a single server and share all available resources,
                            including CPU, memory, disk space and network bandwidth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This simplicity makes shared hosting attractive for beginners and small
                            projects. Setup is usually fast, maintenance is handled by the provider
                            and no server administration knowledge is required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, performance and reliability are limited. Traffic spikes on other
                            websites can negatively affect the shop, and customization options are
                            typically very restricted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shared hosting is suitable for small online shops with low traffic, few
                            products and no complex integrations.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Virtual Private Server (VPS)</h2>
                        <p>
                            A Virtual Private Server is a virtualized environment running on a shared
                            physical server. Each VPS has allocated resources and operates independently
                            from other virtual machines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This isolation provides more consistent performance compared to shared
                            hosting. Server configurations, software installations and security
                            settings can be customized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            VPS hosting represents a balance between cost and control. It is commonly
                            used by growing shops that need better performance without the expense of
                            dedicated hardware.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Basic server administration skills are usually required unless the VPS is
                            offered as a managed service.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Dedicated Server</h2>
                        <p>
                            A dedicated server provides exclusive access to an entire physical machine.
                            All computing resources are reserved for a single shop system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This model offers maximum performance, stability and security. It allows
                            full control over hardware configuration, operating system and software
                            stack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dedicated servers are often used by large online shops, high-traffic
                            platforms or businesses with strict security requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The disadvantages are higher costs and increased complexity. Maintenance,
                            updates and monitoring must be handled internally or outsourced.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Cloud Hosting</h2>
                        <p>
                            Cloud hosting is based on distributed infrastructure rather than a single
                            physical server. Resources are provided from a pool of interconnected
                            machines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the main advantages is scalability. Computing power, storage and
                            bandwidth can be adjusted dynamically depending on current demand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This makes cloud hosting particularly suitable for shops with seasonal
                            traffic, marketing campaigns or unpredictable growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cloud pricing is usually usage-based. While this can be cost-efficient, it
                            also requires careful monitoring to avoid unexpected expenses.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Managed Hosting</h2>
                        <p>
                            Managed hosting focuses on responsibility rather than infrastructure type.
                            The hosting provider takes care of server maintenance, updates, backups,
                            security patches and monitoring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This approach reduces technical workload for shop owners and development
                            teams, allowing them to focus on business and product development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Managed hosting is available for VPS, dedicated and cloud environments and
                            is typically more expensive than unmanaged alternatives.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Key Factors When Comparing Hosting Models</h2>
                        <p>
                            When evaluating hosting models, several factors should be considered:
                            expected traffic volume, performance requirements, security needs,
                            budget constraints and internal technical expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Migration effort is another important aspect. Choosing a model that allows
                            future scaling can save time and costs as the shop grows.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Choosing the Right Hosting Model</h2>
                        <p>
                            There is no single best hosting model for all online shops. Small projects
                            benefit from simplicity, while larger businesses require flexibility and
                            reliability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many successful shops start with shared or VPS hosting and move to cloud
                            or dedicated solutions as demand increases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A well-chosen hosting model provides a stable technical foundation and
                            supports long-term growth without unnecessary complexity.
                        </p>
