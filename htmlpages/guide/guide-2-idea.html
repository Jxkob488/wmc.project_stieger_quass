                    <p>
                        Before choosing a shop system, the shop idea must be clearly defined.
                        The type of product and the scope of the project influence all further decisions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Online shops can sell physical products, digital products or services.
                        Physical products require shipping, stock management and return handling,
                        while digital products are usually delivered automatically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is also important to think about the size of the project.
                        A small shop for a few products has different requirements than a shop
                        that is planned to grow over time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Defining the shop idea at this stage helps avoid choosing a shop system
                        that is either too complex or too limited.
