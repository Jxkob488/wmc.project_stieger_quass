                    <p>
                        Performance optimization is a critical factor for the success of an online shop.
                        Fast loading times, smooth interactions and a stable system directly influence
                        user satisfaction, conversion rates and search engine rankings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In e-commerce, even small delays can make a difference. If pages take too long to load,
                        customers may leave the shop and buy somewhere else. That is why performance is not only
                        a technical topic, but also an important business factor.
                    </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🚀 Why Performance Matters</h2>
                        <p>
                            Users expect websites to load within a few seconds. If an online shop reacts slowly,
                            many visitors will leave before completing a purchase. Search engines like Google
                            also consider page speed as a ranking factor, so slow pages can reduce visibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A well-optimized shop improves the user experience and can reduce server load.
                            This can lower operational costs, especially when the shop grows.
                        </p>

                        <h2>🖼️ Frontend Optimization</h2>
                        <p>
                            Frontend optimization focuses on everything that happens in the user’s browser.
                            This includes the efficient use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A clean and lightweight
                            frontend makes pages load faster and feel more responsive.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>📦 Minification of CSS and JavaScript files</li>
                            <li>🔗 Reducing the number of HTTP requests</li>
                            <li>🖼️ Using modern image formats like WebP</li>
                            <li>⏳ Lazy loading images and media content</li>
                            <li>📱 Responsive layout for mobile devices</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Another important point is image optimization. Product images are often the largest
                            files on an online shop, so compressing them can improve loading speed a lot.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🧠 Backend Optimization</h2>
                        <p>
                            Backend performance is equally important. A slow server response can negate all
                            frontend improvements. Efficient backend systems ensure fast data processing and
                            stable operations, especially during high traffic.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="text-center my-4">
                            <img src="../images/performanceoptimization.png" alt="Backend Optimization Techniques" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Choosing the right hosting model also matters. A shop on weak hosting can become slow
                            even if the code is good. For larger shops, scalable hosting is often necessary.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🧊 Caching Strategies</h2>
                        <p>
                            Caching is one of the most effective ways to improve performance. It stores frequently
                            accessed data so it does not need to be regenerated each time a user visits the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Common caching methods include browser caching, server-side caching and content delivery
                            networks (CDNs). CDNs distribute content globally and reduce loading times for users in
                            different countries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, product images and static files like CSS can be cached very efficiently.
                            This reduces server workload and speeds up the shop for returning visitors.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>📊 Monitoring and Continuous Improvement</h2>
                        <p>
                            Performance optimization is not a one-time task. Shops change over time: more products,
                            more customers and more plugins can slowly reduce performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Monitoring helps identify bottlenecks early. It also makes it easier to test improvements
                            and compare results after updates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many shops use performance tools to check loading times, server response times and user
                            behavior. This helps maintain a high-quality shopping experience.
                        </p>
