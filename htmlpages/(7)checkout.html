                <h1>Checkout Process</h1>

                <p>
                    The checkout process is the final interaction between the customer and the shop.
                    A clear and fast checkout experience is essential, because unnecessary complexity
                    often leads to abandoned carts.
                </p>

                <div class="content-group">
                    <button class="content-toggle">
                        Purpose of the Checkout
                    </button>
                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            The main goal of the checkout process is to guide customers smoothly from
                            their shopping cart to a completed order. Every step should feel logical
                            and predictable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A well-designed checkout builds trust and reduces hesitation at the most
                            critical moment of the buying process.
                        </p>

                </div>

                <div class="content-group">
                    <button class="content-toggle">
                        User Experience & Simplicity
                    </button>
                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            Checkout flows should focus on simplicity. Customers should immediately
                            understand what information is required and why.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Clear input fields, helpful validation messages and minimal distractions
                            significantly improve completion rates.
                        </p>

                        Guest Checkout & Flexibility
                    </button>
                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            Not all customers want to create an account. Offering a guest checkout
                            option removes an important barrier and speeds up the purchase process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Account creation can still be offered after the order has been completed.
                        </p>

                </div>

                        Error Handling & Transparency
                    </button>
                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            Errors during checkout should be communicated clearly and immediately.
                            Customers need to know what went wrong and how to fix it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Transparent pricing, shipping costs and delivery times help avoid surprises
                            and increase trust.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            Many purchases are completed on mobile devices. Checkout processes must
                            therefore be optimized for smaller screens and touch input.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Large buttons, simple forms and responsive layouts are key to a successful
                            mobile checkout experience.
