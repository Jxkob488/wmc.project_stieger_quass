                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The checkout process is one of the most critical parts of an online shop.
                            It represents the final step before a purchase is completed and therefore
                            has a direct impact on conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A well-designed checkout should be simple, fast and transparent.
                            Customers must clearly understand each step, what information is required,
                            and what the final cost will be before confirming their order.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Checkout Steps</h2>
                        <p>
                            Most modern shop systems follow a structured checkout flow that guides
                            users through the purchase without overwhelming them.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cart overview with selected products</li>
                            <li>Customer information (name, email, address)</li>
                            <li>Shipping method selection</li>
                            <li>Payment method selection</li>
                            <li>Order review and confirmation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            These steps can be implemented as a single-page checkout or as a
                            multi-step process, depending on the complexity of the shop and the
                            target audience.

                    <section>
                        <h2>User Experience & Usability</h2>
                        <p>
                            A smooth user experience is essential during checkout. Forms should be
                            clearly structured, labels easy to understand and error messages helpful.
                            Autofill and validation features reduce user effort and prevent mistakes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Progress indicators help users understand how many steps are left, which
                            reduces frustration and increases the likelihood of completing the purchase.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Security & Trust</h2>
                        <p>
                            Customers must feel safe when entering personal and payment information.
                            A secure checkout process includes HTTPS encryption, trusted payment
                            providers and visible security indicators.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trust badges, clear privacy policies and transparent pricing also
                            contribute to customer confidence and reduce cart abandonment.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Mobile Checkout</h2>
                        <p>
                            With a growing number of users shopping on mobile devices, the checkout
                            process must be fully responsive. Buttons should be large enough to tap,
                            forms easy to fill out and unnecessary steps avoided.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mobile-optimized checkout designs significantly improve completion rates
                            and overall user satisfaction.
                        </p>
