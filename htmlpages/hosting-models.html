    <h1>Hosting Models</h1>
    <p>
        Shop systems can be delivered in different ways. <br>
        <strong>Cloud-based (SaaS)</strong> systems run on the provider's servers,
        and the provider takes care of updates, security, and maintenance. <br>
        <strong>Self-hosted</strong> systems are installed and run on the user's own servers
        or web hosting. In this case, the user is responsible for installation, security, and maintenance.
        The choice of hosting model affects costs, flexibility, and technical effort.
        <p>Cloud-based hosting models are more expensive in the long run, but cheaper initially because no technical setup is required.</p>
