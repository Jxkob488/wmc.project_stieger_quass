        <section id="saas">
            <h2>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h2>
            <p>Fully hosted, cloud-based applications that are rented as a service. The provider handles hosting,
                updates, and security.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examples: Shopify, BigCommerce, SaaS admin tools</li>
                <li>Advantages: quick setup, low maintenance</li>
                <li>Disadvantages: ongoing fees, limited customization</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="paas">
            <h2>PaaS (Platform as a Service)</h2>
            <p>Platforms that provide runtime environments, databases, and deployment tools—developers build and run
                apps without managing infrastructure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine</li>
                <li>Advantages: focus on development, automatic scaling</li>
                <li>Disadvantages: platform lock-in, less control over the environment</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="iaas">
            <h2>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)</h2>
            <p>Virtual servers, storage, and networking resources in the cloud. Highly flexible, technical
                administration remains with the user.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examples: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine</li>
                <li>Advantages: full control, highly scalable</li>
                <li>Disadvantages: responsibility for security, backups, and updates</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="managed-hosting">
            <h2>Managed Hosting</h2>
            <p>Hosting providers manage server operations such as updates, backups, and monitoring. Customers use
                dedicated or virtual servers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examples: Managed VPS, Managed WordPress hosting</li>
                <li>Advantages: less operational burden than self-hosting</li>
                <li>Disadvantages: higher costs compared to basic hosting</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="self-hosted">
            <h2>Self-hosted / On-premises</h2>
            <p>Infrastructure is owned and operated by the organization, either on-site or via a data center under full
                customer control.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Advantages: maximum control, easier compliance management</li>
                <li>Disadvantages: high cost for hardware, maintenance, and security</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="cloud-hosting">
            <h2>Cloud Hosting (public / private / hybrid)</h2>
            <p>Hosting in public or private cloud environments, or a mix (hybrid). Provides scalability and flexible
                pricing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public cloud: cost-effective, highly scalable</li>
                <li>Private cloud: more control, better for strict compliance needs</li>
                <li>Hybrid cloud: combines advantages of both</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="selection-criteria">
            <h2>How to Choose the Right Model?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify requirements: traffic, data sensitivity, budget, scalability.</li>
                <li>Evaluate available IT resources and expertise.</li>
                <li>Check compliance and data protection needs (e.g., GDPR).</li>
                <li>Consider long-term flexibility: how hard is it to switch later?</li>
                <li>Test where possible: proof-of-concept or pilot projects.</li>
            </ol>
