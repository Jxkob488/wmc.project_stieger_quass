                    <p>
                        The cost structure of an online shop describes all expenses required to
                        build, operate and scale a shop system. These costs depend heavily on the
                        chosen platform, hosting model and functional requirements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some costs are fixed and predictable, while others vary depending on traffic,
                        sales volume or feature usage. Understanding these cost categories is essential
                        for realistic budgeting and long-term planning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Especially in early project phases, costs are often underestimated. While
                        initial setup expenses are visible, ongoing operating costs tend to grow
                        gradually as the shop evolves.
                    </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Platform and License Costs</h2>
                        <p>
                            Many shop systems charge licensing fees, either on a monthly or yearly
                            basis. These costs can be fixed or scale with factors such as revenue,
                            number of products or users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Open-source platforms may not require license fees, but often involve
                            higher costs for development, customization and maintenance.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Hosting Costs</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hosting costs depend on the selected hosting model and the technical
                            requirements of the shop. Shared hosting is usually inexpensive, while
                            cloud or dedicated servers can become a significant cost factor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As traffic increases, hosting expenses typically rise due to higher
                            resource consumption and scalability needs.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Themes and Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            Design costs range from free standard themes to professionally designed
                            premium templates or fully custom layouts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Custom designs improve branding and user experience but usually require
                            higher upfront investment and ongoing adjustments.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Plugins and Extensions</h2>
                        <p>
                            Plugins and extensions add functionality such as payment methods,
                            marketing tools or analytics. Many extensions are offered as subscriptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While individual plugins may appear inexpensive, the total cost can grow
                            quickly when multiple extensions are required.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Maintenance and Support</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ongoing maintenance includes updates, security patches, backups and bug
                            fixes. These tasks are essential to ensure stability and data protection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Costs arise either through internal staff, external service providers or
                            managed service packages.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Transaction and Payment Fees</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment providers usually charge transaction-based fees. These costs scale
                            directly with sales volume and can have a noticeable impact on margins.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shops with high order volumes should carefully compare payment providers
                            to optimize long-term costs.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Scaling and Hidden Costs</h2>
                        <p>
                            As an online shop grows, additional costs often appear. These include
                            performance optimization, advanced security measures and system upgrades.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Planning for scalability helps avoid unexpected expenses and ensures
                            sustainable growth.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            A transparent cost structure provides a solid foundation for business
                            decisions. Understanding both initial and ongoing costs allows shop owners
                            to choose solutions that match their budget and growth strategy.
                        </p>
