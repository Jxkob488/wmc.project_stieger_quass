                        <p>
                            Templates define the visual appearance and basic structure of an online shop.
                            They determine how content is arranged, how navigation works and how users
                            interact with the website. A well-designed template has a strong influence
                            on usability, user experience and brand perception.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In most shop systems, templates provide a ready-made layout that can be
                            customized to fit the individual needs of a business. This allows shop
                            owners to create a professional-looking online store without designing
                            everything from scratch.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Purpose of Templates</h2>
                        <p>
                            The main purpose of templates is to offer a structured and consistent design
                            framework. They define elements such as headers, footers, product listings,
                            navigation menus and typography.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By using templates, businesses can significantly reduce development time
                            and focus more on content, products and marketing instead of technical
                            design details.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Design & User Experience</h2>
                        <p>
                            A good template ensures that users can navigate the shop intuitively and
                            find products quickly. Clear layouts, readable fonts and consistent color
                            schemes contribute to a positive user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Templates should follow modern design standards and usability principles.
                            Poorly designed templates can confuse users, reduce trust and negatively
                            impact conversion rates.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Customization & Flexibility</h2>
                        <p>
                            Templates differ in how flexible they are. Some templates allow only minor
                            visual changes, while others support extensive customization of layout,
                            colors and components.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flexible templates are especially important for businesses that want to
                            reflect a strong brand identity. Customization options help align the shop
                            design with corporate branding guidelines.

                        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern templates must be responsive, meaning they automatically adapt to
                            different screen sizes such as desktops, tablets and smartphones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Responsive templates ensure a consistent user experience across devices
                            and are essential due to the increasing number of mobile shoppers.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Performance & Maintenance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Template quality also affects performance. Heavy templates with unnecessary
                            scripts or images can slow down page loading times and negatively impact
                            search engine rankings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well-maintained templates receive regular updates to remain compatible with
                            new shop system versions and security standards. Choosing reliable templates
                            reduces long-term maintenance effort.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Choosing the Right Template</h2>
                        <p>
                            Selecting the right template depends on business goals, target audience,
                            technical skills and budget. Smaller shops often benefit from simple
                            templates, while larger projects may require premium or custom-built designs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The right template balances design, functionality and performance, creating
                            a solid foundation for a successful online shop.
                        </p>
