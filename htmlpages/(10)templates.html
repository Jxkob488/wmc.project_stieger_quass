                    <p>
                        Templates define the visual appearance and basic structure of an online shop.
                        They decide how content is arranged, how navigation works and how customers
                        interact with the website. A good template has a strong influence on usability,
                        user experience and brand perception.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In most shop systems, templates provide a ready-made layout that can be customized
                        to fit the needs of a business. This allows shop owners to create a professional
                        looking store without designing everything from scratch.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Especially for smaller shops, templates are a practical solution because they save
                        time and often already include important pages like product listings, category pages
                        and a clean checkout layout.
                    </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>📌 Purpose of Templates</h2>
                        <p>
                            The main purpose of templates is to provide a structured and consistent design
                            framework. They define elements such as headers, footers, product listings,
                            navigation menus and typography.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By using templates, businesses can reduce development time and focus more on
                            content, products and marketing instead of technical design details.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another advantage is consistency. Customers quickly get used to the layout, which
                            makes it easier to browse products and finish the checkout process.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>✨ Design & User Experience</h2>
                        <p>
                            A good template ensures that users can navigate the shop intuitively and find
                            products quickly. Clear layouts, readable fonts and consistent colors contribute
                            to a positive user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Templates should follow modern design standards. If a template looks outdated,
                            customers may lose trust and leave the shop, even if the products are good.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Small details like button placement, spacing and product image sizes can also
                            affect how professional the shop feels.
                        </p>

                        <h2>🛠️ Customization & Flexibility</h2>
                        <p>
                            Templates differ in how flexible they are. Some allow only basic changes such as
                            colors and fonts, while others support more advanced customization of layout and
                            components.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flexible templates are important for businesses that want a strong brand identity.
                            Customization helps align the shop design with a logo, brand colors and a specific
                            style.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, more customization usually means more effort. If a template is heavily
                            modified, updates can become harder because changes may break after new versions.

                        <h2>📱 Responsive Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern templates must be responsive, meaning they automatically adapt to different
                            screen sizes such as desktops, tablets and smartphones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Responsive templates are essential because many customers shop on mobile devices.
                            If the template is not mobile-friendly, users may struggle with navigation or
                            checkout forms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good responsive design also improves readability and makes product images look
                            good on every device.
                        </p>

                        <h2>⚡ Performance & Maintenance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Template quality affects performance. Heavy templates with unnecessary scripts,
                            animations or large images can slow down page loading times and negatively impact
                            search engine rankings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well-maintained templates receive regular updates to stay compatible with new shop
                            system versions and security standards. Choosing reliable templates reduces long-term
                            maintenance effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is also important to test the template after updates, because small design changes
                            can affect important parts like the shopping cart or product pages.
                        </p>

                        <h2>✅ Choosing the Right Template</h2>
                        <p>
                            Selecting the right template depends on business goals, target audience, technical
                            skills and budget. Smaller shops often benefit from simple templates, while larger
                            projects may require premium or custom-built designs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The right template balances design, functionality and performance. A clean and fast
                            template helps customers find products quickly and increases the chance of completing
                            a purchase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before choosing a template, it is useful to check if it supports important features
                            like product filters, good mobile layout and a clear checkout.
                        </p>
