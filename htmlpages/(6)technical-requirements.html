                    <p>
                        Technical requirements describe the basic technology a shop system needs in order to work
                        reliably. They are important because an online shop must be available 24/7, protect customer
                        data and still run fast even when many users visit the website at the same time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the technical foundation is too weak, problems like slow loading times, checkout errors or
                        security issues can occur. That is why server performance, software compatibility and regular
                        maintenance are essential parts of every professional shop system.
                    </p>

                        <h2>🖥️ Server & Infrastructure</h2>
                        <p>
                            A shop system needs a stable server infrastructure to store product data, customer accounts
                            and orders. The server must also handle traffic peaks, for example during discounts,
                            seasonal sales or marketing campaigns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Important factors are enough CPU power, sufficient RAM, fast SSD storage and a reliable
                            internet connection. Many shops start with simple hosting and upgrade later to VPS or cloud
                            solutions when the business grows.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cloud environments can be helpful because they allow scaling, meaning more resources can be
                            added when demand increases.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🧑‍💻 Software & Technologies</h2>
                        <p>
                            Shop systems usually run with server-side technologies such as PHP or Node.js. A database
                            is also required to store important information like products, orders and customers.
                            Common databases are MySQL or PostgreSQL.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the frontend, modern web standards like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are necessary.
                            Responsive design is also important so the shop works well on phones, tablets and desktops.
                            Frameworks like Bootstrap can support this.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🔒 Security Requirements</h2>
                        <p>
                            Security is one of the most important technical requirements in e-commerce. Shops handle
                            personal customer data, addresses and sometimes payment information. Because of that, SSL/TLS
                            encryption (HTTPS) is required to protect data during transmission.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shop systems also need protection against typical attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site
                            scripting (XSS) and brute-force login attempts. Regular updates and strong passwords are a
                            basic part of security.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Backups are another important requirement. If something breaks or data is deleted, backups
                            allow the shop to restore important information.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>⚡ Performance & Scalability</h2>
                        <p>
                            Fast loading times improve the user experience and can increase sales because customers are
                            less likely to leave the website. Performance is also important for SEO, because search
                            engines prefer fast websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Common performance improvements include caching, optimized images and efficient database
                            queries. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can also help by delivering content faster to
                            international users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Scalability means the shop can grow with the business. A scalable system can handle more
                            products, more users and more orders without needing a complete rebuild.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🌐 Compatibility & Maintenance</h2>
                        <p>
                            A shop should work in different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Edge. It should also
                            support mobile devices, because many customers shop on their smartphones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maintenance includes updates, monitoring and bug fixing. A well-documented system makes it
                            easier to maintain the shop and add new features in the future.
                        </p>
