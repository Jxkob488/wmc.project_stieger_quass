                <h1>Technical Requirements</h1>

                <p>
                    A reliable shop system needs a solid technical foundation. Performance, security
                    and scalability all depend on the underlying technology. The following sections
                    explain the most important technical requirements in a practical and understandable way.
                </p>

                <div class="content-group">
                    <button class="content-toggle">
                        Server Performance & Speed
                    </button>
                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            Fast loading times are essential for user experience and conversion rates.
                            A shop system must be able to handle traffic spikes without slowing down.
                            This requires sufficient server resources, optimized software configuration
                            and efficient caching mechanisms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Customers expect pages to load within a few seconds. If performance is poor,
                            many users leave before completing a purchase.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="content-group">

                        Security & Data Protection

                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            Online shops process sensitive customer and payment data, which makes security
                            a critical requirement. A secure shop system protects data against unauthorized
                            access and cyber attacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This includes encrypted connections, regular software updates and compliance
                            with legal requirements such as GDPR.
                        </p>

                        Scalability & Reliability

                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            As a business grows, the shop system must grow with it. Scalability ensures
                            that increased traffic, more products and higher order volumes can be handled
                            without technical problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reliable systems minimize downtime and ensure that the shop is available
                            even during high-demand periods such as sales or promotions.

                        <p>
                            Modern shops rarely work as standalone systems. They need to integrate with
                            payment providers, shipping services, ERP systems and marketing tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A flexible shop system offers interfaces and extensions that allow new
                            features to be added without rebuilding the entire platform.

                        <p>
                            A large percentage of customers shop on mobile devices. Therefore, the
                            frontend must adapt smoothly to different screen sizes and input methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Responsive design, touch-friendly navigation and optimized media loading
                            are essential for a professional mobile shopping experience.
                        </p>

                            A shop system is not a one-time setup. Regular maintenance is required to
                            keep the software secure, stable and compatible with new technologies.
                        </p>

                            This includes updates, backups and monitoring to quickly detect and resolve
                            potential issues.
