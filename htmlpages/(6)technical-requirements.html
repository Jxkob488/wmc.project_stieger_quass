                    <p>
                        Technical requirements define the fundamental technological foundation of an online shop.
                        They ensure that the system is stable, secure, scalable and compatible with modern web
                        standards. Without solid technical requirements, long-term operation and future growth
                        become difficult or even impossible.

                        <h2>Server & Infrastructure</h2>
                        <p>
                            A shop system requires a reliable server infrastructure that can handle traffic peaks,
                            especially during promotions or seasonal sales. Depending on the hosting model, this can
                            be achieved through shared hosting, virtual private servers or cloud-based solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Important factors include sufficient CPU performance, enough RAM, fast SSD storage and
                            high network availability. Cloud environments additionally allow automatic scaling when
                            demand increases.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Software & Frameworks</h2>
                        <p>
                            The shop system must be compatible with modern server-side technologies such as PHP,
                            Node.js or Java, depending on the chosen platform. Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL or
                            MongoDB are commonly used to store product, customer and order data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the frontend, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are essential. Frameworks like Bootstrap help
                            to create responsive layouts that work on all screen sizes and devices.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Security Requirements</h2>
                        <p>
                            Security is a critical technical requirement for any e-commerce platform. SSL/TLS
                            encryption is mandatory to protect customer data during transmission. Additionally,
                            secure authentication mechanisms and regular software updates are required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Protection against common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS)
                            and brute-force attacks must be implemented. Regular backups ensure data recovery
                            in case of system failures.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Performance & Scalability</h2>
                        <p>
                            Fast loading times are essential for a good user experience and search engine ranking.
                            Caching mechanisms, optimized database queries and content delivery networks (CDNs)
                            help to reduce response times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system should be scalable so that it can grow with the business. Modular
                            architectures and cloud services make it easier to add new features or increase
                            capacity without downtime.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Compatibility & Maintenance</h2>
                        <p>
                            The shop system must be compatible with different browsers and devices. Regular testing
                            ensures consistent behavior across platforms. Maintenance tasks include updates,
                            monitoring and performance optimization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A well-documented system simplifies maintenance and allows developers to extend or adapt
                            the shop efficiently in the future.
                        </p>
