                    <p>
                        Internationalization describes the technical and structural preparation
                        of an online shop to operate in multiple countries and markets.
                        It ensures that the shop system can adapt to regional differences
                        without requiring major changes to the core system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Expanding into international markets increases reach and revenue potential,
                        but also adds complexity. Language, currency, legal regulations and customer
                        expectations vary significantly across regions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A shop system that supports internationalization from the beginning
                        makes future expansion easier and reduces long-term costs.
                    </p>

                        <h2>Multilingual Content</h2>
                        <p>
                            One of the most important aspects of internationalization is language
                            support. Product descriptions, navigation, error messages and emails
                            must be available in multiple languages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shop systems often use language files or translation modules to manage
                            multilingual content efficiently.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Multiple Currencies</h2>
                        <p>
                            International shops typically need to display prices in different
                            currencies. This includes correct currency symbols, rounding rules
                            and exchange rate handling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some systems allow automatic currency conversion, while others require
                            manual configuration.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Localization of Formats</h2>
                        <p>
                            Localization goes beyond language. Date formats, number formatting,
                            units of measurement and address structures differ between regions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Proper localization improves usability and reduces confusion for
                            international customers.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Tax and Legal Requirements</h2>
                        <p>
                            Different countries have different tax rates, VAT rules and legal
                            requirements. These must be handled correctly to avoid legal issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Advanced shop systems support country-specific tax rules and legal
                            configurations.
                        </p>

                        <h2>International Payment and Shipping</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment preferences vary by country. While credit cards are common in
                            some regions, others rely on local payment methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shipping options, delivery times and costs must also be adapted to
                            international logistics.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Challenges of Internationalization</h2>
                        <p>
                            Internationalization increases operational complexity. Content
                            management, customer support and compliance require additional effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Without proper planning, costs and maintenance overhead can grow quickly.

                        <p>
                            Internationalization enables long-term growth by opening new markets.
                            A shop system with strong internationalization support provides a
                            scalable foundation for global expansion.
