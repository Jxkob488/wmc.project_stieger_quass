                <h1>Payment Methods</h1>

                <p>
                    Payment options are a central factor for trust and conversion in online shops.
                    Customers expect familiar, secure and convenient payment methods that fit their
                    personal preferences and regional habits.
                </p>

                        Role of Payment in Online Shops
                    </button>
                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            Payment is one of the final steps in the purchasing process and therefore
                            highly sensitive. If customers do not find a suitable payment option,
                            they often abandon the checkout entirely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A well-designed payment setup increases confidence and reduces friction
                            at the most critical moment of the buying journey.

                        <p>
                            Different target groups prefer different payment methods. While some users
                            favor credit cards, others rely on digital wallets or buy-now-pay-later
                            services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Offering multiple options allows shops to address a broader audience
                            without forcing customers into unfamiliar processes.

                        Costs & Fees
                    </button>
                    <div class="content-details">
                        <p>
                            Payment providers usually charge transaction-based fees. These costs vary
                            depending on the provider, the country and the selected payment method.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For international shops, additional costs such as currency conversion
                            fees and chargebacks must also be considered.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Security is a key requirement for payment processing. Customers must trust
                            that their data is handled safely and professionally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secure payment systems rely on encryption, fraud prevention mechanisms
                            and compliance with industry standards such as PCI-DSS.

                        <p>
                            International shops often need to support region-specific payment methods
                            to meet local expectations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Adapting payment options to different markets can significantly improve
                            conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
