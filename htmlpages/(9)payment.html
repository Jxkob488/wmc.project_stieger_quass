                        <h2>Importance of Payment Systems</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment processing is one of the most sensitive and critical parts of an
                            online shop. It represents the final step in the purchasing process and
                            directly influences customer trust, conversion rates and overall satisfaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If customers do not find their preferred payment method or feel insecure
                            during payment, they are likely to abandon the checkout even after selecting
                            products and entering personal data.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Common Payment Methods</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern online shops usually offer a variety of payment options to meet
                            different customer expectations and regional habits.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Credit and debit cards</li>
                            <li>Online wallets (e.g. PayPal)</li>
                            <li>Bank transfer and instant payment systems</li>
                            <li>Buy-now-pay-later services</li>
                            <li>Invoice and cash-on-delivery (in some regions)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Offering multiple payment methods increases flexibility and reduces the
                            risk of abandoned carts.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Payment Providers</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment providers act as intermediaries between the shop, the customer
                            and financial institutions. They handle transactions, security checks
                            and sometimes currency conversion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Choosing a reliable payment provider is essential, as it affects fees,
                            supported payment methods, settlement times and customer experience.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Security & Compliance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Security is a core requirement for payment systems. Customers must trust
                            that their financial data is protected against unauthorized access.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Important security measures include encrypted data transmission (HTTPS),
                            tokenization of payment data and compliance with industry standards such
                            as PCI-DSS.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Costs and Fees</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment processing usually involves transaction fees charged by payment
                            providers. These fees vary depending on the payment method, transaction
                            volume and country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shops must carefully calculate these costs, as they directly impact
                            profit margins, especially for low-priced products.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>International Payments</h2>
                        <p>
                            International shops often need to support multiple currencies and
                            region-specific payment methods. Currency conversion, local regulations
                            and tax requirements must be considered.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Adapting payment options to local markets significantly improves
                            conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
                        </p>
