                        <h2>⭐ Importance of Payment Systems</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment processing is one of the most sensitive and critical parts of an online shop.
                            It represents the final step in the purchasing process and directly influences customer trust,
                            conversion rates and overall satisfaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If customers do not find their preferred payment method or feel insecure during payment,
                            they are likely to abandon the checkout even after selecting products and entering personal data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good payment system should be fast, reliable and easy to understand. Clear information about
                            fees, confirmation messages and secure payment pages can strongly improve the user experience.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>💰 Common Payment Methods</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern online shops usually offer a variety of payment options to meet different customer expectations
                            and regional habits. Customers often choose the method they trust the most or the one that is quickest.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>💳 Credit and debit cards</li>
                            <li>👛 Online wallets (for example <a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal</a>)</li>
                            <li>🏦 Bank transfer and instant payment systems</li>
                            <li>🕒 Buy-now-pay-later services</li>
                            <li>🧾 Invoice and cash-on-delivery (in some regions)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Offering multiple payment methods increases flexibility and reduces the risk of abandoned carts,
                            because customers are not forced into one option.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🏢 Payment Providers</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment providers act as intermediaries between the shop, the customer and financial institutions.
                            They handle transactions, security checks and sometimes currency conversion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A provider can also simplify the integration of many payment methods. For example, a shop can use
                            one system like <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a> to accept credit cards and
                            other payment options without building everything from scratch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Choosing a reliable payment provider is essential, as it affects fees, supported payment methods,
                            settlement times and the overall customer experience.
                        </p>

                        <h2>🔒 Security & Compliance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Security is a core requirement for payment systems. Customers must trust that their financial data
                            is protected against unauthorized access.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Important security measures include encrypted data transmission (HTTPS), tokenization of payment data
                            and compliance with industry standards such as PCI-DSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many shops also use fraud prevention systems to detect suspicious orders, for example when a customer
                            places many orders in a short time or uses unusual shipping addresses.
                        </p>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>💸 Costs and Fees</h2>
                        <p>
                            Payment processing usually involves transaction fees charged by payment providers. These fees vary
                            depending on the payment method, transaction volume and country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shops must calculate these costs carefully, because they directly impact profit margins. This is
                            especially important for low-priced products, where fees can take up a bigger percentage of the sale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some providers also charge monthly base fees or extra costs for chargebacks (refunds caused by disputes).
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mt-4">
                        <h2>🌍 International Payments</h2>
                        <p>
                            International shops often need to support multiple currencies and region-specific payment methods.
                            Currency conversion, local regulations and tax requirements must be considered.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Adapting payment options to local markets improves conversion rates and customer satisfaction, because
                            customers can pay with familiar methods in their own currency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            International payments can also take longer to process depending on the country and the chosen payment
                            method, which is why clear communication is important.
                        </p>
